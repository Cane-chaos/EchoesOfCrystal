## 🎮 Implemented Pseudocode

All requested pseudocode has been implemented:

### Movement System
```cpp
// From MapState::movePlayer()
int steps = roll_d6();
Vec2i target = advance(currentPos, dir, steps, mapBounds);
if (tileAt(target) == ROCK) pos = stepBefore(target, dir);
else pos = target;

switch (tileAt(pos)) {
  case PIT: requestStackPush(StateID::Coin); break;
  case RIFT: requestStackPush(StateID::Dice); break;
  case ARROW: dir = arrowDirection(pos); break;
  case ENEMY: requestStackPush(StateID::Combat); break;
  case BOSS: requestStackPush(StateID::Combat); break;
}
```

### Combat Flow
```cpp
// From CombatState combat loop
while (player.alive() && foe.alive()) {
  bool allowSkill = coinFlipWithGuess();
  Action act = allowSkill ? chooseSkillOrNormal(player) : NormalAttack();
  resolve(act, player, foe);
  
  if (!foe.alive()) break;
  
  Action enemyAct = enemyAI(foe, player);
  resolve(enemyAct, foe, player);
}
```

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

### Quick Start (Linux/Mac)
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install libsfml-dev nlohmann-json3-dev  # Ubuntu
brew install sfml nlohmann-json                   # macOS

# Build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
./MiniGameSFML
```

### Windows (vcpkg)
```cmd
vcpkg install sfml:x64-windows nlohmann-json:x64-windows
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## 🎯 Key Implementation Highlights

### 1. **State Machine Pattern**
Clean state transitions with proper resource management and event handling.

### 2. **Component-Based UI**
Reusable UI components (Button, Bar, Panel) with consistent styling and behavior.

### 3. **Flexible Combat System**
Skill system with factory pattern, type effectiveness, and extensible AI.

### 4. **Procedural Map Generation**
Configurable tile distribution with pathfinding validation.

### 5. **Robust Save System**
JSON serialization with proper error handling and data validation.

## 🚀 Ready for Extension

The codebase is designed for easy extension:

- **Add new tiles**: Extend TileType enum and implement behavior
- **Add new skills**: Create factory methods and add to Pokemon skill sets
- **Add new Pokemon**: Inherit from Pokemon base class
- **Modify map generation**: Adjust constants or algorithms
- **Add new states**: Inherit from State base class
